// Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
// gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
// Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
// one average score per team).
// A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
// Otherwise, no team wins!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
// 2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
// 3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
// as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
// to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
// Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
// 4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
// Data 2
// 5. Ignore draws this time
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
// § Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
// Hints:
// § To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
// § To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.
// Apply this to the team's average scores  

const calcAverage = (a, b, c) => (a + b + c) / 3;
const avgDolhins = calcAverage(44, 23, 71)
const avgKoalas = calcAverage(65, 54, 49)

const checkWinner = function (avgDolhins, avgKoalas) {
    if (avgDolhins >= 2 * avgKoalas) {
        console.log(`Dolphin wins (${avgDolhins}vs ${avgKoalas})`)
    }
    else if (avgKoalas >= 2 * avgDolhins) {
        console.log(`Koalas wins (${avgKoalas} vs ${avgDolhins})`)
    }
    else {
        console.log('No wins')
    }

checkWinner(avgDolhins, avgKoalas)
